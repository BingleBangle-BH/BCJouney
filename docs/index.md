# About meeeeh

Heya! I'm an amateur pentester interested in smart contract security. This is a journal of my smart contract security audits walkthrough for various boxes! My walkthrough are based on trial and error with limited knowledge of my pea brain. If you found any error or items that I can improve in my walkthrough, drop me a message on my github. Cheers!
