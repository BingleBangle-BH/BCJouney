# Blockchain Journey

Heya! I'm an amateur pentester interested in smart contract security. This is a journal of my smart contract and if you stumble across this if you're in need of a walkthrough, you're in luck! My walkthrough are based on trial and error with limited knowledge of my pea brain. If you found error or items I can improve in my walkthrough, kindly drop me a message on my github. Cheers!
